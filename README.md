Polynomial Solver Using Newton’s Method

# Overview
This project implements a polynomial solver using Newton’s Method. The solver approximates the roots of polynomials by iteratively applying Newton’s formula. The project is written in Java and includes custom classes such as Linked Lists, Monomials, and a Polynomial class for efficient polynomial handling and manipulation.

# Features
Polynomial representation using Linked Lists.
Newton’s Method for finding polynomial roots.
Exception handling for cases like maximum iterations exceeded or division by zero.

# Classes
Node.java: A generic node class for linked lists.
OrderedLinkedList.java: An ordered linked list that maintains polynomial terms in descending order.
Monomial.java: Represents individual monomials in a polynomial.
Polynomial.java: Stores polynomials and implements methods to evaluate, derive, and find roots using Newton’s Method.
SolutionNotFound.java: Custom exception class for errors during Newton’s Method execution.

# Technologies Used
Java: Main programming language for the implementation.
Running the Project
Compile and run the classes in any Java-supported IDE.
Execute the TestNewton.java file to test Newton’s method on sample polynomials.
